# PolyBench.jl

This package is a Julia port of the [PolyBench](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~pouchet/software/polybench/) 4.1 benchmark suite used to evaluate the effectiveness of the polyhedral optimizer Polly in an Julia environment.

## Installation

You can install PolyBench.jl via executing the following command in your Julia REPL:

```
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/singam-sanjay/PolyBench.jl")
```

## Loading and running the benchmarks

Before the benchmarks can be run they have to be loaded:

```
julia> using PolyBench
julia> PolyBench.load!()

loading jacobi-2d...done (took 1.210474674) seconds)
loading seidel-2d...done (took 1.334741505) seconds)
```

The benchmark suite can then be run via the following command:

```
julia> run(PolyBench.SUITE, verbose=true)
(1/30) benchmarking "deriche"...
done (took 21.685070286 seconds)
(2/30) benchmarking "2mm"...
